# Airline Pilot Log API

Welcome to the Airline Pilot Log API repository! This API is designed to manage a digital logbook for airline pilots, allowing them to record their daily flight experiences.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js and Express:** The backend of the API is built using Node.js along with the Express.js framework to handle HTTP requests and routes.

- **TypeScript:** TypeScript is used to add static typing to our codebase, enabling early error detection during development and improving project scalability.

- **JSON:** Flight log information is stored in JSON files for easy data manipulation and persistence.

## Features

- **Logbook Management:** Pilots can create, read, update, and delete logbook entries using the API.

- **Sensitive Data Protection:** A mechanism is implemented to remove sensitive information before returning responses, ensuring pilots' privacy.

- **Data Validation:** The API performs thorough validation of incoming data to ensure its integrity and consistency.
